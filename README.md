# [The LaTeX Boilerplate](http://kenlimmj.github.com/latex-boilerplate/)

The LaTeX Boilerplate is a professional document template for creating beautiful documents in LaTeX.

The recommendations in this boilerplate are curated from the community knowledge of [Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) and the advice of the enlightened user-at-large. While it promotes the use of certain packages over others, feel free to change what you will and keep what you want.

## Rationale

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting tool favoured by academic communities worldwide for the versatility and beauty it provides when preparing documents. The learning curve is steep, but while many eventually manage to produce a decent document, not everyone does it correctly in the way it was intended. LaTeX is largely syntax dependent, and to some extent the quality of the syntax determines the quality of the typesetting. This boilerplate encourages that. 

LaTeX is also old. While LaTeX3 is in development, much of the current framework dates back to standards and work done a decade ago. Packages and fixes exist to rectify many of these problems, but are not immediately accessible to the amateur LaTeX writer. This boilerplate brings these things closer. 

## Dependencies

* [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)
* [XeTeX](http://tug.org/xetex) (if system font support is required)

## Quick Start

This assumes you have a functional installation and functional knowledge of LaTeX. If you don't, you'll need to solve the Navier-Stokes Equation to prove your worth. Kidding. Grab an install for your operating system from the links below, then grab a coffee.

* [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) (Windows)
* [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/) and [TexLive](http://tug.org/texlive) (OS X)

Once you've got everything up and running, open ```template.tex``` in your favourite text editor (we recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)), add text, compile, and profit.
